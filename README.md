Welcome to the Altair 8800 emulator repo. If you're interested in [retrocomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocomputing), software development, AI, cloud services, and climate monitoring you've arrived at the right repo.

The [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800?azure-portal=true) kick-started the personal computer revolution. Microsoft's first product was [Altair BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC?azure-portal=true) written for the Altair 8800 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. At the time, Altair BASIC was a huge step forward as it allowed people to write programs using a high-level programming language.

The Altair project can run standalone and is a fantastic safe way to explore machine-level programming, Intel 8080 Assembly programming, along with C and BASIC development.

Optionally, the project integrates free weather and pollution cloud services from [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org), along with [Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/iot-central/), and [Azure Anomaly Detection Cognitive Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/). The following reports were generated from data published by the Altair emulator using data sourced from Open Weather Map.
